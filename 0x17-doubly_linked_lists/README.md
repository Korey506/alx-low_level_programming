0x17-doubly_linked_lists

Doubly Linked Lists in C are complex compared to a singly linked list. A doubly linked list consists of two pointers that store the address of the next successive node and the address of the previous node. The traversal in a doubly linked list happens in both forward and backward directions. A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node is divided into two parts, data, and address. Every node in a linked list is linked together. 

A Doubly linked list is complex compared to a singly linked list. Each node is divided into three parts to store data and the addresses of the previous and next nodes. In a doubly linked list, the first node prev and last node next pointers point to the null, indicating no nodes before or after it.

It is easy to access elements in the doubly linked list since it consists of two pointers to traversal from forward and backward directions.
